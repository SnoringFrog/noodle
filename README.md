On 12/13/13, thoughtbotters took a break from client work and paused for play.

What started as a rudimentary zsh history analysis tool quickly became a kata, to be implemented in many languages so as to compare them.

As a history analyzer, it's fairly useless. But as an excuse to play with new languages, it's just right.

Feel free to noodle around.
